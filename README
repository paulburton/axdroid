AxDroid: Android for Dell Axim X50/X51(v) PDAs

Requirements:
	Git, repo & CVS
	CodeSourcery G++ Lite 2010q1-202 for ARM GNU/Linux
	arm-mingw32ce from the cegcc project
	Usual android building stuff like JDK5

To build, just run ./build.sh and hopefully everything will happen automagically. The default is a test build, which is almost like a release build but with certain things like a telnet daemon and the android logger enabled. If you pass the -d flag, you'll get a debug build. If you pass the -r flag, you'll get a release build.

I accept no responsibility for Axims which break, spontaneously combust, or grow legs and run away.
