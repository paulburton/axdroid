AxDroid: Android for Dell Axim X50/X51(v) PDAs

Requirements:
	Git, repo & CVS
	CodeSourcery G++ Lite 2010q1-202 for ARM GNU/Linux
	arm-mingw32ce from the cegcc project
	Usual android building stuff like JDK5

The scripts mountloop/umountloop can make life easier if you setup sudo	to not ask for your password when you run them. Get them from:
	http://www.paulburton.eu/downloads/shellscripts/mountloop
	http://www.paulburton.eu/downloads/shellscripts/umountloop
and put them somewhere in your path if you like. If you don't have them building will still work, you'll just have to enter your password

You probably want to set the AXDROID_SD environment variable, eg:
	export AXDROID_SD="/media/AXDROIDSD /media/SD-1024"
will output to both those cards (if they're present)

To build, just run ./build.sh and hopefully everything will happen automagically. The default is a test build, which is almost like a release build but with certain things like a telnet daemon and the android logger enabled. If you pass the -d flag, you'll get a debug build. If you pass the -r flag, you'll get a release build.

I accept no responsibility for Axims which break, spontaneously combust, or grow legs and run away.
